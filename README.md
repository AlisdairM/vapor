Vapor Experimental C++ Standard Library
=======================================

This repository contains an evolving, experimental implementation of the C++
Standard library, declared in namespace 'vapor' rather than namespace 'std'.


Why Vapor?
==========

The name is inspired by the term "vaporware", as this library is intended to
never be relied on for production software, and indeed, is unlikely to ever be
complete.

In practive, this libray is expected to be tracking bleeding-edge
implementations of compilers, often relying on unreleased trunk builds, in
order to experiment with the latest features of future C++ Standards.  It is
intended to serve as a playground to explore library design and implementation
in an evolving language.

In addition to exploring new language features, it will also explore how
language revisions may impact coding conventions.

Goals
=====

Vapor intends to be a full implementation of the C++ Standard library, with the
exception of the language-support parts that are intimate with the compiler.
It should be able to build on any platform with a free-standading library.


What's New
==========

**February 2017** 

Initial creation of the repository, basic documentation, and project plan.


Basic Build Instructions
========================

To follow, but kind of important!


License
-------

No specific license has been chosen yet, but a permissive open source license
such as the Boost license is the eventual goal.


Question, Comments and Feedback
